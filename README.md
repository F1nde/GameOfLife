# GameOfLife

The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a mathematical and cellular automaton created by British mathematician John Conway in 1970. It consists of a grid of cells that can be in one of two states, alive or dead. The cells evolve over discrete time steps based on a set of rules. Each cell's state depends on the states of its neighboring cells. The game is known for its simplicity and ability to produce complex and unpredictable patterns, making it a popular subject of study in mathematics and computer science. It's not a traditional board game with winners and losers but rather a simulation that demonstrates how simple rules can lead to intricate and dynamic patterns.
